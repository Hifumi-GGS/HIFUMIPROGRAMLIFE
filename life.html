        At first I am very unaware of what programming is,
         not until I asked my father about tech and he told me that the ones that create robots are "Computer Engineers", that's when I started getting interested in the course of ROBOTICS and PROGRAMMING then 10th grade came I was very surprised and excited when I heard that we will be having a ROBOTICS class for the whole year. Then the school year started and after waiting for weeks i'm finally gonna start learning how do I program my own robot. <br>The class has started and our teacher introduced us to Arduino UNO a microcontroller board based on the ATmega328P, and he thought us how do pins work and how to make it work then 3rd quarter came. At the start of the quarter we were tasked to create a research paper and make the product we put in the research paper, hearing that made me frustrated we barely know how to operate the arduino as he was always absent and barely present in the first 2 quarters but my passion for coding was high so I did not give up, I stayed up late for 2 weeks straight just to learn the functions of the arduino then another week for creating the research paper for my group, then the day of the research paper presentation came, all of my classmates including me, our research paper was accepted and asked us to proceed on creating the product, then days passed by I finished the product and I did all on my own because my group mates are
        "busy" even though they're not, I finished our miniature tollgate that uses RFID and it was a success then I passed it to my teacher then our teacher surprised us with the phrase "whoever creates their product successfully will be granted 100 final grades for remaining semester" then obviously we got 100, after getting that 100 I had nothing to do anymore and decided I should help the group of the girl I like for I was a simp before XD, then I thought I was only gonna help them slightly but ended up me taking over the whole project and I created their product named "Gas Detector" after succeeding on creating their project I decided to help the other group but ended up doing it all alone again I made the last 2 projects which are automatic trashcan and protective vault system with password. After doing all that we all ended up with 100 as our final grade, and after all my help I haven't got any thanks or compensations so I learned that I should choose who I help and decided to not help anyone again

        Entering SHS at a different school made me excited especially for the strand I chose (ICT-COMPUTER PROGRAMMING) the school year started where I forgot all I the knowledge I learned in the previous year but the muscle memory is still there so re-learning coding was easy for me what made me struggle the most is the flowchart as for I only know how to directly code but after time passed I eventually got accustomed on making a flowchart. Then we were introduced on C++ it was surprisingly easy for me maybe because of my background coding but remembering all of the functions and conditions was very easy for although I struggled in pattern making especially the triangle things but eventually I learned how it works and got good grades after learning it then final milestone came where I was tasked to create linear programming a program which calculates 3x3 or more matrices we were only tasked to create addition but I decided to create reciprocation, multiplication and subtraction in addition to the main tasks assigned I decided to do that to challenge myself to more complicated problem statements, which surprisingly went pretty smoothly and well I finished it with the time of 1-2 weeks which is pretty decent time for such complicated code and that's all to my C++ journey. My C++ journey was pretty short compared to my arduino cause there are little to no interesting things that happened in that time so that's all there is to it.<br><br>
